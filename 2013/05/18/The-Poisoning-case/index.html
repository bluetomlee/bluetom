    <h3 class="post-title">The Poisoning case</h3>
    <section class="post-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">
      <div><br><br>Hello,everyone.Today i want to talk about The poisoning case of Zhuling.The poisoning case happened in 1994 and<br><br>the victim,Zhu Ling, was an extraordinary student in Tsinghua university.This beautiful girl was outstanding in her<br><br>studies and good at playingall kinds of traditional Chinese musical instruments, and she was even a swimming athlete .<br><br>She was always described as perfect byher classmates.<br><br>However, Jealousy from roommates almost killed Zhu Ling and devastated her peaceful family. Zhu’s roommate Sun<br><br>Wei  poisoned Zhu by using Thallium, which is a extremely poisonous chemical substance. It was accompanied by pain<br><br>in her legs, loss of muscular eye control, and partial facial paralysis. She was unable to breathe on her own and placed on<br><br>a respirator. Frustrated by doctors inability to administer the anecdote in time. Her friend Bei Zhicheng‚She posted SOS on<br><br>internet and hoped to focus experts attention to diagnose Zhu‚Ling disease. Fortunately, she was saved by assistance of<br><br>overseas doctors. But because of it lasted for too long, Zhu was paralyzed forever, her brain was damaged by the poison and<br><br>her intelligence quality only equaled to a 5-year old child.<br><br>Discussion and speculation have never stopped on whether someone attempted to murder her through thallium poisoning,<br><br>although the police have yet to give a definite answer. Zhu’s roommates, Sun Wei, had been deemed the one and only suspect<br><br>by Zhu’s parents. Sun Wei was Zhu’ classmate, roommate, and teammate on the college folk music team. According to some<br><br>Tsinghua students and professors, Sun was doing a research with her professor at that time, and was the only student that had<br><br>access to thallium. Besides, due to her close relationship with Zhu, she had the best chance and time to poison Zhu. Some well-informed classmates of Zhu even pointed out that Sun Wei was the would-be poisoner. Besides, police also indicated that Sun Wei was the murderer. Tsinghua university even denied to give her the<br><br>graduation certificate and Bachelor degree certificate. Though she was released, she was murderer in people’s  mind.<br><br>You may wonder why Sun Wei was released and till now there is no answer for the tragedy. Many media were afraid of telling<br><br>the truth. But for conscience sake, I have to talk it out. I believe god is watching and devil will be judged. That is because Sun<br><br>Wei has a strong political background. Her grandfather is Sun Yueqi was the vice president of Democratic Revolutionary Council.<br><br>And some of her uncles were also the governors of government. So, no one dared to put this devil into prison.<br><br>During years, Sun Wei spared no efforts to escape from China and get a Visa, She changed her name constantly and even forged<br><br>her identification documents. She was rejected millions of times by embassies of different countries. But several years ago,<br><br>she married a American citizen and got into the United States.<br><br>Like many people in China, I kept quiet and always weak in character when face unfairness and injustice in front of power in the<br><br>past. But this time I decide to stand out and make my voice heard. All the kind people in China hope that Sun Wei can be repatriated<br><br>to China and go through the investigation again. Zhu is still alive and she was looked after by her old parents. Their life is painful.<br><br>But they are still waiting for the justice to come. It is you who can help them to fulfill the justice.<br><br>Here is a famous line in Shakespeare‚as well known tragedy Hamlet: To be or not to be, that’s a question. Perhaps all the men<br><br>will face the similar dilemma in certain point of life: to survive or to die, to fight or to surrender. It is time for you to choose.<br></div>
